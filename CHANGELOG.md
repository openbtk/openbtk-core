# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

While the version is `0.x`, breaking changes may land in a minor release and are
recorded here.

## [Unreleased]

Next: **M1 — Core framework.** Registry, base classes, configuration, error
hierarchy, PHI-redacting logging, run provenance, and the shared contract test
suite every component implementation must pass.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-30

**Placeholder release. The package installs and imports; it does not yet do
anything.** Published to reserve the name on PyPI and to exercise the release
pipeline end to end on a version that does not matter. Do not build on this.

### Added
- `src/openbtk/` package skeleton: 16 subpackages, each documenting its intended
  contents, plus a PEP 561 `py.typed` marker.
- Packaging via hatchling with `hatch-vcs`, so the version is derived from the
  git tag and cannot drift from it.
- Exactly six core dependencies — `pydantic`, `numpy`, `structlog`, `pyyaml`,
  `httpx`, `typing-extensions` — with a test asserting the budget and rejecting
  `langchain`, `langgraph`, `torch`, `transformers` and `spacy` from core.
- Optional extras: `text`, `ehr`, `retrieval`, `llms`, `langchain`, `all`,
  `dev`, `docs`.
- 23 packaging tests: import with zero extras, import from a working directory
  outside the repository, wheel layout, `py.typed` presence, forbidden package
  names, and the core dependency budget.
- Three enforced import-linter contracts: layered architecture, modality
  independence, and LangChain confined to its optional adapter.
- Pre-commit hooks: ruff, `mypy --strict`, detect-secrets, plus project guards
  against the `opentbtk` typo, `src.` imports, and `load_all()` in examples.
- CI across 3 operating systems × 3 Python versions, running the suite from
  outside the repository so a path-relative import cannot fake a pass.
- Release workflow: tag-triggered, main-only, TestPyPI verification across the
  full matrix before PyPI, publishing via Trusted Publishing with attestations.
- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, bundled into the distribution.

### Notes
This release deliberately contains no functionality. The previous codebase was
removed rather than repaired: it was never importable — three package names
coexisted in one repository, and no test had ever been executed against an
installed dependency. It is preserved on the `legacy/v1-snapshot` branch.
